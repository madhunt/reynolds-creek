# Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed
Array data from RCEW prescribed burn.


## Repository Overview

All data stored in `data` folder, including raw miniseed files, survey coordinates, and processed data.



## Field Site
The study region is the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW), located in the Owyhee Mountains of southwestern Idaho, about 80 km southwest of Boise, ID. A prescribed burn was carried out in RCEW by the Bureau of Land Management on 06 Oct 2023, with an intended purpose of decreasing the juniper population for grazing cattle. The proposed prescribed burn area was approximately 9.4 km^2. The elevation of the burn region ranges from 1457 m to 1870 m, with slopes from 0-25%.

In total, 75 infrasound sensors were deployed in arrays within the burn area and surrounding region between Aug and Oct 2023, including the 44-element TOP array.

    <figcaption> Severity of RCEW prescribed burn on 06 Oct 2023. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) calculated with B8A and B12 (NIR, SWIR) from 20 m resolution Sentinel-2 images corrected to surface reflectance. Differenced NBR (dNBR), calculated between pre-burn (2023-09-28) and post-burn (2023-10-08) images, ranges from unburned land (light grey) to low severity (yellow) to moderate severity (dark red). Proposed extent of prescribed burn (black outline) sourced from the BLM. Infrasound sensor arrays (blue triangles) surveyed in Oct 2023. Elevation contour lines (dark grey) are 1:24000, sourced from the USGS. </figcaption>
